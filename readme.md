## Description
This project is a basic input/output back-end API program built in PHP 7 using the Laravel framework. Using Postman application, it acts as the front-end and takes input, sending it to the API which validates and purifies the data. If one of the two required fields is missing, there is an error message. Otherwise there is a string output using the user's input.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run 'composer install' to install all of the necessary libraries, and 'php artisan serve' to run the server. You may then open this server connection in Postman. Open your terminal or GitBash and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Simpsond87/API-Routes.git
cd API-Routes
composer install
php artisan serve
```
